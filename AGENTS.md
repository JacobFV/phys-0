# Agent Handoff For phys-0

This repo contains a local LeRobot experiment platform. The stdio MCP server
and Electron GUI both use the same TypeScript Node backend. The backend owns
experiments, SQLite persistence, blob artifacts, GPT-5.5 streaming sessions,
and the small Python bridge that talks to LeRobot/OpenCV.

## Start Here

Read these files before operating hardware:

1. `README.md`
2. `docs/architecture.md`
3. `docs/setup.md`
4. `docs/operations.md`
5. `docs/pose-table.md`
6. `docs/kinematics.md`
7. `docs/desktop.md`
8. `docs/troubleshooting.md`

## Known Local Defaults

```text
robot id: mcp_so101
serial port: /dev/cu.usbmodem5AB01815731
camera id: 0
pose resource: lerobot://pose-table
data store: data/phys0.sqlite
blob store: data/blobs
```

Calibration file:

```text
/Users/vibestartup/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/calibration/robots/so_follower/mcp_so101.json
```

For a new physical arm, do not reuse that file. Create a new robot id and run:

```sh
npm run calibrate:so101 -- \
  --port /dev/tty.usbmodem5A460833421 \
  --robot-id mcp_so101_b
```

The deterministic calibration prompts for `Z1`, `X1`, `X2`, `X3`, `Z2`, and
`Hand` endpoints, then writes the LeRobot calibration JSON and servo register
limits for that robot id.

The Electron app also has a top-right **Calibrate** button that opens the same
deterministic workflow as a visual GUI. It lists detected robot buses and shows
the actual upstream SO-101 visual URDF/STL mesh model with a live raw-position
overlay plus an endpoint guide pose. Use the GUI when the human operator should
be guided step-by-step rather than reading terminal prompts.

The main Electron window also renders live 3D SO-101 mesh panels beside the
camera panels, one per detected connected robot bus. These panels visualize
raw servo state; they are not collision or workspace guarantees.

## Run Server

```sh
npm install
npm run build
node src/apps/mcp-node/dist/server.js
```

## Optional Voice Environment

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=... # optional
export ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=... # optional
```

`OPENAI_API_KEY` is required for GPT-5.5 sessions and `listen_to_human`.
`speak_to_human` uses OpenAI TTS by default. `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is optional
and only needed for `provider: "elevenlabs"`; `provider: "system"` uses macOS
speech without an API.

## Codex MCP Config

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "phys-0": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/vibestartup/Code/lerobot-test/src/apps/mcp-node/dist/server.js"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Safe Operating Sequence

1. `create_experiment`; keep the returned `experiment_id`.
2. If multiple arms are present, call `set_default_robot(robot_id)` or pass
   `robot_id` into each robot-aware tool.
3. Read `lerobot://pose-table`.
4. `list_cameras` with the `experiment_id`.
5. `view_camera` with `camera_id: 0` and the `experiment_id`.
6. `probe_feetech` with `max_id: 6` and the `experiment_id`.
7. Confirm servo IDs `1..6`, model `777`, baud `1000000`.
8. `connect_so101`.
9. `observe`.
10. `get_arm_pose`.
11. Move with `set_arm_pose` for joint-space control or `set_position` for IK.
12. Use `ask_export(question)` only as a placeholder for future expert review;
    it currently returns `expert not available`.
13. Use `speak_to_human` before risky or ambiguous actions and
    `listen_to_human` to capture the reply.
14. Keep `max_step <= 5` unless a human explicitly approves otherwise.
15. Use `list_agent_session_events` and `list_experiment_artifacts` to review
    the run.
16. `disconnect`.

MCP clients cannot fully mirror their chat history into phys-0. Passing
`experiment_id` into tool calls is therefore required for useful MCP-side
experiment logs. Electron sessions are preferred when full streaming message
history is needed.

## Preferred Joint-Space Motion Tool

Use `set_arm_pose`:

```json
{
  "pose": {
    "shoulder_pan": -109,
    "shoulder_lift": 0,
    "elbow_flex": -70,
    "wrist_flex": 0,
    "wrist_roll": -164,
    "gripper": 0.5
  },
  "max_step": 5,
  "allow_out_of_range": false
}
```

All six pose values are required.

## Cartesian IK Tools

Use `get_position` to read `[x, y, z, gripper]` in meters plus percent gripper.
Use `set_position` for bounded IK moves:

```json
{
  "x": 0.18,
  "y": 0.02,
  "z": 0.45,
  "gripper": 20,
  "max_step": 5,
  "tolerance_m": 0.004,
  "max_position_error_m": 0.03,
  "allow_out_of_workspace": false,
  "allow_out_of_range": false
}
```

The server uses `assets/kinematics/so101_kinematics.urdf` with LeRobot's
`RobotKinematics` and `placo`.

## Critical Spatial Note

Physical visual feedback established:

```text
shoulder_lift around +108 looked down/floor-parallel
shoulder_lift around 0 looked roughly 90 degrees/upright
shoulder_lift around -96 overshot past upright
```

Do not assume joint names imply visual direction. Use camera frames.

## Testing

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src/lib .venv/bin/python -m py_compile src/apps/python-bridge/bridge.py src/lib/phys0/core.py
npm run build
npm audit --omit=dev
```

See `docs/testing.md` for MCP-level and hardware-level tests.

## If Hardware Fails

If no servos respond, do not move. Check:

- external servo power,
- USB-C,
- bus cable channel,
- jumper/channel,
- cable polarity,
- serial port already in use.

Then run `probe_feetech` again.


## Chemist-0 context. 
This should always be in context in any skill being run.
The agent is a chemist performing a titration experiment as described in [experiment.md](experiment.md) file.

The human inputs an experimental objective through the electron app. It reasons about what each reagent is, and uses Bayesian optimization to find the recipe that minimizes solution resistance while keeping pH in a target window, either yellow, green or blue via bromothymol blue. Mid-run, the agent commits to a hypothesis about reagent identities; the human operator reveals the truth; the agent updates and continues.

The agent has these actions:
- Pick up vial
- Infer vial pH from colour
- Infer vial identity among: vinegar, NaCl solution, baking soda, borax
- Combine vial A and vial B in new vial
- Pick up multimeter probe
- Dip multimeter probe into solution and read resistance
